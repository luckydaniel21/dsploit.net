-------------

dSploit is an Android network analysis and penetration suite which aims to offer to IT security experts/geeks
**the most complete and advanced professional toolkit** to perform network security assesments on a mobile device.

Once dSploit is started, you will be able to easily map your network, fingerprint alive hosts operating systems
and running services, search for **known vulnerabilities**, crack logon procedures of many tcp protocols, perform
man in the middle attacks such as **password sniffing** ( with common protocols dissection ), real time **traffic
manipulation**, etc, etc .

This application is still in **beta stage**, a stable release will be available as soon as possible, but expect
some crash or strange behaviour until then, in any case, feel free to submit an issue here on GitHub.

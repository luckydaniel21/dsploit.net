#### Simone Margaritelli ( evilsocket ) lead developer, website mantainer.

I'm a sr. developer and security consultant from Italy, specialized in Unix derived systems such as GNU/Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X and on Microsoft platforms programming. I have strong technical background in ethical hacking and security assessments, both for web and stand alone applications. I've published some essays about computer security, biometrics and artificial intelligence as well as many open source projects ( i'm an open source activist ) mainly hosted on GitHub. Security researcher, activist, hardcore developer and coffee addicted :)

I've just built a <a href="http://update.dsploit.net/nightly">new nightly release</a> and uploaded the signed APK since many of you guys was asking for it, I'm sorry if I didn't make a new release every day, but there were a lot of small changes and fixes I wanted to incorporate in a whole new package.  
This is a changelog with major changes. All of this thanks to **Massimo Dragano** ( tux-mind ) who's actively working on the project.
The new release aims to improve integration with the Metasploit framework, fix many issues, improve spawned processes handling and â€¦ fix the LD_LIBRARY_PATH bug/limitation!

Have an happy new year guys, and remember to make a donation to the project!

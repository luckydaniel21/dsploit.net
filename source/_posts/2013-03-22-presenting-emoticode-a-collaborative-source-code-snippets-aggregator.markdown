I'd like to introduce you another project of mine, a website called [EmotiCODE ](http://www.emoticode.net/):)

**EmotiCODE** is a **collaborative** source code snippets aggregator and search engine but mostly a place where developers can find the **answers** they are searching for and contribute with their own contents to **help others** with the same needs.

<!-- more -->

The main concept behind emoticode is _"as a developer i own a lot to people publishing source codes, snippets and guides on the internet, the less i can do is do my best to help the internet back"_, therefore we encourage people to register ( the process is pretty straightforward ) and post every bit of code they have/use/find on the internet, because even the smallest three-line-snippet could solve someone else problems while developing a project ... you never know :)

You can also, as a **registered user**, mark snippets you find more interesting and/or usefull to you as your favorites, clicking on the thumb icon on the left of every element. This will allow you to find them easily in the future on your profile page and will let other user have an idea on your tastes or specific needs.

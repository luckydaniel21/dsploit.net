Here I am, after more than a year dSploit being a reality, I feel I have to give some updates to the users and be honest to them.  
dSploit was born as a game, a little project to fill empty afternoons of the summer of two years ago and a challenge with myself, as the majority of the open source projects I publish.  

As soon as I published it on my github account, the project had a **huge** spin in its visibility, most of it thanks to the XDA community and the dozens of blogs that talked about it, so what initially was just a game suddenly became something big.  
As many of you might already know, I work as a software developer, so basically I have the infinite luck to work with what I most enjoy and am passionate about â€¦ but I have bills to pay, a rent for the house I live in and the free hours I have to work on my open source projects are getting fewer and fewer every month.  

Moreover, although dSploit is actually one of the most used applications around the globe by security geeks, it didn't received the contribution it needed by the open source community. Many people offered themself to help, some of them were in the **Team** page for a few weeks too, before I removed them since not a single commit was sent to improve dSploit, or at least fix some minor bug.  

**Open source** doesn't mean "hey dude, this is cool and free, come and get it!", actually it means "this is cool and free, use it and **improve it**".  
I'm ok with the fact that not everybody is a developer, and even among developers not everyone is able to code something like dSploit ( I'm not acting like I am the best dev around, this is just a fact), but **I can't believe** that no one, and I mean **NO ONE** among the dSploit users ( especially people from github ) has the time or the skills to submit me patches, new features or any kind of piece of code that could help.

<!-- more -->

This is, or better this **was** a great and big project, I can't ( and actually don't want to ) work on dSploit alone anymore, reading notifications of people opening issues on github day by day, without a single line of code being written by anyone else but me.  
So, dSploit will stay opensource and its code will remain on the github repository, but I'm not going to work on it anymore.  

You want your issue being fixed? You want a feature being implemented? That's ok, you know where the source code is, you are free to fork it, patch it, play with it and do basically whatever you want with it.

It was a great adventure, but now it has to come to an end.

Hi guys, after more than four months from the last release of dSploit, i've decided to open this blog and continuing dSploit developing.

I'd like to say to all of you guys that I'm sorry for this pause period, but as someone already knows, i've recently switched to a new job which is very time taking ( andÂ exciting of course! ) therefore i hadn't any free time to work on my projects.

<!-- more -->

Contrary to what many have said, **dSploit is NOT dead** or abandoned ... i've decided to completely redesign its user interface and rewrite its code from scratch to have a really stable version by the beginning of the summer.

I'm gonna write on this blog about dSploit developing process and generally about IT security and related topics ... stay tuned!

_PS: I'm really sorry if my english it's not 100% correct, i'll try to improve that too :D_

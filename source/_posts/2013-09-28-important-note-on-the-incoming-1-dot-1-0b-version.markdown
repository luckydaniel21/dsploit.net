After more than a year a new beta version v1.1.0b is coming, featuring full localization for many languages, a complete graphical restyling and
many minor optimizations and fixes.  
Unfortunately I've lost the original certificate I used to sign dSploit packages on each release, this means that the auto update mechanism between
the current 1.0.31b and the new 1.1.0b version will not work.  
You **will** be prompted for the new update and you **will** be able to download it, but installation will fail since the two apks will have different
signatures and Android considers this as APK tampering.  

Therefore a manual installation for the new version will be required then, starting from 1.1.0b the auto update process will continue to work as usual
since I'm gonna backup the certificate everywhere :D

Please do not use the comment box to ask **when** the new release will be available, multi languages localizations need to be finished and only then
I will release the new APK.

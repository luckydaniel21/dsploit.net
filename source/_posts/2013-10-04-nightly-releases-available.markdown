Since many of you asked how to compile dSploit themself to try the new features, and many of you had problems with that ( yeah I know, building an Android app
is not as easy as compiling a "Hello World", right? ), I decided to make nightly built apk available for everyone.

Important Notes

* Nightly releases could be **extremely** unstable, therefore **Issues** for those releases **won't be accepted**.
* It's not guaranteed to have a release every single day, I will build one when a new feature is implemented.

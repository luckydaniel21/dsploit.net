As you might notice from the right sidebar, dSploit is now a [Pledgie](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/22257) powered project, this means
that you can now donate any amount you want with ease.  

**Please consider to make a donation to help us keeping the project alive** and pay the monthly server and bandwidth price, or if you 
can't afford a donation **spread the word** about dSploit and Pledgie donations ... thanks! <3

### Introducing dSploit



dSploit is an Android network analysis and penetration suite which aims to offer to **IT security** experts/geeks **the most complete and advanced professional toolkit** to perform network security assesments on a mobile device. Once dSploit is started, you will be able to easily map your network, fingerprint alive hosts operating systems and running services, search for known vulnerabilities, crack logon procedures of many tcp protocols, perform man in the middle attacks such as password sniffing ( with common protocols dissection ), real time traffic manipulation, etc, etc . This application is still in beta stage, a stable release will be available as soon as possible, but expect some crash or strange behaviour until then, in any case, feel free to submit an issue on GitHub.


### Why ?


You might ask why there's the need of another tool like zAnti, NetSpoofer, DroidSheep, FaceNiff, etc.
Well, first of all, the only software which is comparable to dSploit in terms of features and support is zAnti ( refer to the following comparison table ), which is a proprietary tool and obviously closed source.
Don't get me wrong, i have **nothing** against proprietary software, i've been in contact with zAnti staff for a while now, i think they're a really great and open minded team, but closed source is closed source, there's no community contribution and most of all, you have to pay for it. Secondly, every tool i've found was very specific, none of them had every feature i needed so most of the times i had to use three or four tools at a time, which is kinda frustrating.
Therefore, dSploit was born, only one ( open source ) tool to rule them all! :D
